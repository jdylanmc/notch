Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` before acting. Confirm the
assigned worktree, approved scope, foundation gate, and validation ownership.
Do not implement new features just because a ticket is labeled ready.

Capture `git rev-parse HEAD` before editing as the review base. Preserve unrelated
local changes and identify any relevant pre-existing changes in the review scope.

Use /tdd at pre-agreed seams, with Swift/XCTest and existing targets. Run the
smallest relevant canonical checks during iteration and the full verification
gate required by the task before reporting completion. Honor authoring-only
phases; documentation-only work does not require launching the app.

Once done, use /caveman-review in working-tree mode against the captured base,
including new files. Fix in-scope findings and repeat affected checks. A
committed-only diff cannot review work that has not been committed yet.

Use the project /caveman-commit to draft the message for an authorized commit.
It does not stage files or run git. Stage only this task's files and commit only
when authorized. A request to
implement does not itself authorize pushing, merging, releasing or closing
issues. Report any pending gate rather than treating a commit as completion.
