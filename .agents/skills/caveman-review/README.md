# caveman-review

Read-only Standards/Spec review with concise findings. Location, problem, fix.

## What it does

The local adaptation collects committed or working-tree evidence, including
new files, and assesses repository standards and the approved spec separately.
It reports findings in `L<line>: <severity> <problem>. <fix>.` format, preserving
exact locations and symbols. Severity: 🔴 bug, 🟡 risk, 🔵 nit, ❓ question.
It can also format completed findings supplied explicitly by another workflow
without repeating that analysis.

Auto-clarity: drops terse mode for CVE-class security findings, architectural disagreements, and onboarding contexts where the author needs the *why*. Resumes terse for the rest.

Read-only — does not change code, approve, request changes, or run linters.

## How to invoke

```
/caveman-review
```

Also triggers on "review this PR", "code review", "review the diff".

## Example output

```
L42: 🔴 bug: user is optional after first(where:). Unwrap with guard let before reading email.

L23: 🟡 risk: no retry on 429. Wrap in withBackoff(3).
L107: ❓ q: why drop the cache here? Reads on next request will miss.
```
